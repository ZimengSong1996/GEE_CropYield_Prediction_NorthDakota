This research project, a collaborative team assignment at UCL CASA, led to the development of an agricultural forecasting application named CropInvest. This exciting outcome was the result of concerted efforts by team members: `ofitrahramadhan`, `burhanucl2023`, `LiangWeiXian11`, `Vannie777`, `jianghan0v0`. 

My responsibilities within the team encompassed leading the data collection and processing, designing the front-end interface of CropInvest, overseeing the construction of the overall architecture, and managing subsequent documentation and website optimization tasks.

The construction of the application primarily utilized Google Earth Engine (GEE) and JavaScript for building the predictive models, while Python was employed to test three distinct models.

CropInvest targets a diverse user base, including banks, government agencies, farmer associations, and non-profit organizations, offering access to historical yield data from 2018 to 2023. It further refines yield data generation and forecasting at a pixel level, allowing users to freely select specific agricultural areas for analysis.

The initial framework of CropInvest laid the groundwork for agricultural yield prediction, featuring the ability to synchronously update predictive layers and historical yield data. This functionality facilitates the generation of diverse charts, enhancing the user interface. While the app serves as a valuable starting point, the current version already boasts significant practical utility.
